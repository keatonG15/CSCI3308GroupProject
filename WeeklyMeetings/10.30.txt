What have you done since the last meeting?
This is our first team meeting! 

What are you planning to do until the next meeting?
Joao and Alex: Focus on SQL- Back End
Quincy: HTML - Front End
Keaton: JavaScript - Bridge
Alex and Joao come up with a table on how to organize, link, and access all SQL tables
Alex make sure the non-project specific items are on schedule (consistent weekly commits, meeting scheduling, etc…)
Quincy come up with basic UI/Wireframe for HTML page
Keaton think of ways to link the UI to the SQL
Keaton make sure project specifics are on schedule (SQL deadlines, HTML scheduling, etc…)
What are the challenges you are facing?
We are struggling to come up with potential challenges we will run into. As of now, we have a solid idea of what we will do and have already assigned roles for each member’s strengths and weaknesses.

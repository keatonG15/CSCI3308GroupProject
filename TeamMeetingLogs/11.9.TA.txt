11/9 Team 016-001
Intended Strategy
Week1: Get basic HTML page running with login and registration complete
Week2: Familiarize with Trivia API and how to run the correct axios call
Week3: Get Full page running
Week4: Debug, test, and add functionalities

Prioritize the Trivia API, getting it linked to our page and rendering with random questions may be difficult

Backup plan… manually create a database of trivia questions and the necessary components, may be menial, but could be necessary if the trivia API is troublesome

What are the features you are planning to implement?
Trivia API
Populate the trivia page with questions/answers from the API
Updating score when correct, ending game when incorrect

What have you done since the last meeting?
Built directory structure
Finished deliverable.txt
Established ways to work on git repo and save to main branch

What are you planning to do until the next meeting?
Get docker container up and running
Figure out the trivia API 

What are the challenges you are facing?
We cant get all teammembers to run docker compose up without an error, potentially and issue with repository ownership?

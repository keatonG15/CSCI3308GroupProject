Brief Application description
 Our trivia game, Think Tank Trivia, will provide users with a fun 
and engaging game that challenges random knowlege of users! Users 
will be able to register for their own account, upon logging in 
they will be greeted with a homepage that displays the option to
play a new game, view history of previously played games, and 
shows the user's unique highscore.
    If the user wants to play a game, they may have the option to 
select a genre (History, Art, Computer Science, Sports, etc...)
(this will be an added functionality) and will then be prompted with
a trivia question and 4 buttons, with one button containing the 
correct answer. If the user selects the correct answer, their score
will increase, if not, the game will end and display the score. If
the score exceeds the user's highscore, it will update in the database
and redirect to the homepage. 
    If the user wants to view a history of played games, they can
see a list of users who answered x number of questions with a score
of x. We may order this to make a 'leaderboard' based on highscore.
We will build this with basic implementations, and using our agile
planning strategy, will make changes and add functionality as we see fit.

USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING
======================================================================================================================================================================================

1. USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOGIN WITH CREDENTIALS

A user will not be able to login without the mandatory fields:
    - username
    - password

For testing we will need to register the following credentials: 
    username: matt
    password: 123

We will be using the mocha enviornment for testing with a describe titled: 'Testing Login APIs'
The it will be: 'Successfull Login'

In are test case will will send the above credentials to the '/login'.

When test case works then we will expect the status to have a 302.
With our game we also expect to redirect to the '/home' page so the user can get started with the game.  

Our test results will come up as passing when 

This test case that we are using insures that users that have a registered account will be properly loaded and redirected to the home page. 

======================================================================================================================================================================================

2. USER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOGIN WITH INVALID CREDENTIALS

A user will not be able to login with inccorrect inputs in the mandatory fields:
    -username
    -password

For Testing we can use any combiation of username and password that is not already registered to the database. 

We will be using the mocha enviornment for testing with a describe titled: 'Testing Login APIs'
The it will be: 'Negative Login'

For our example we sent the following credentials because they were not registered.
    username: mattfregahgjnd         
    password: 123

Since we are expecting a failed login we must return a 200 status and our response is to NOT REDIRECT. This is because we are throwing an error message on the login page
to tell users they have the wrong credentials. If the page redirects this is incorrect because we do not want unathourized users to enter and start playing the game because 
this would cause a lot of errors and flaws

Overall, this test case we are insuring that when logged in with incorrect credentials we tell the user and stay on the login. 

======================================================================================================================================================================================

3. USER SHOULD SUCCESSFULLY RENDER HOME PAGE WHEN LOGGED IN

In this test case we are using what we did above to login and then we are checking that the username and highscore match and the home page renders

Just like we did in test case 1 we are going to need to use the following credentials to send to the API 
    username: matt
    password: 123

We will be using the mocha enviornment for testing with a describe titled: 'Testing home APIs'
The it will be: 'Should successfully render the home page'

Then within the first chai we create another one that gets the home page and sends the res.body.username and res.body.highscore.
If these variables match then we expect the server to have a 200 (successful status) 

We expect that this has a 200 status as it is successfully rendered. The main goal of this test case is to make sure that the home page is successfully rendered when logged in.
This insures that after login the user encounters no errors when trying to play the game after login.
